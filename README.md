# MARS-TASK-2
# THOUGHT PROCESS:
This was my first time doing a practical experiment. All this while it was only on tinkercad. I had a lot of fun doing tinkercad but this was way beyond that.
Every step was pretty exciting.
I was very nervous and excited for this. I had way too much fun with this whole session. I definetly learned way more than I knew 3 hours back. 
I felt nervous every time my code had errors but also super excited every time I could move on to the next step like connecting batteries or testing out the motor or the sensor. I thought I wouldnt be able to get any output but I'm really thrilled that I did. It was very overwhelming having access to so much information online from mutliple websites. Looking at so many variations of the connections of the motor to the board and the sensor, including the codes. There were multiple ways the code could've been written and I was super confused looking at all of them, but after executing the codes, I got numerous errors and with some help after fixing them, I learnt. I definetly learned atleast 5-7 more commands than I knew 3 hours before. Solving every error and making sure the connections were right at all times and debugging the code. Every step was a learning process for me. This was very fun, I hadn't realised that three hours had gone by and I did'nt feel tired or bored once. This was a very fun experience and I loved every second of it and I'm definetly buying an Arduino come summer.
# STEPS:
-> Gather Ultrasonic sensor, Arduino board, Motor and Motor driver.
-> Connect the gnd and vcc pins of sensor to gnd and 5v respectively on the Arduino board.
-> Connect the trig and echo pins of the sensor to the digital pins on the board.
-> Connect the pwm and dir pins of motor driver to the digital pins on the board.
-> Connect the gnd of the motor driver to the gnd of the Arduino board.
-> Connect the black and red of the motor to the motor driver.
-> Connect the battery to the motor driver.
-> Write the code on Arduino IDE and upload it to the board.

# APPLICATIONS:
-> This could be used in Tesla cars where by measuring the distance of the person standing in front of the car, it moves automatically until it comes to the person.
Here the distance is detected from the car using the ultrasonic sensor and the motor moves driving the car forward and stopping at a particular distance from the person by detecting from the ultrasonic sensor.
The speed of the car could also be controlled depending on the distance.
If the car is farther away it could move with a faster speed and it could slow down whilst approaching the person.
